# Indian_Census

SQL project for Indian Census involves exploring data that includes demographics such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as information on education, employment, income, and housing.
Once the data is collected, it cleaned and normalized to ensure that it is accurate and consistent. 
SQL queries are written to extract specific information about the population, such as the number of people in a certain age group, the percentage of people with a certain level of education, or the average income of a particular demographic.
